# coursera-scala
This folder contains my solutions to the lecture exercises and problem sets for the Coursera specialization [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala).

I have tried to make these solutions as clean and efficient as possible, but if you see any possible improvements let me know!
